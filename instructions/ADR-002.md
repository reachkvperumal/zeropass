# ADR-002: Enforce TLS for All External Communication

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2025-12-25

## Context

Authentication traffic contains sensitive artifacts (challenges, assertions,
session identifiers, and tokens).
Transport security is required to prevent interception and tampering.

## Decision

Enforce TLS for all externally exposed communication paths
(e.g., Web Client to API Gateway)
and require secure transport for token exchanges.

## Consequences

- Improves confidentiality and integrity for in-transit data.
- Requires certificate issuance/rotation, monitoring, and a minimum TLS
  version policy.
- Clients and intermediaries must support the chosen TLS configuration.
