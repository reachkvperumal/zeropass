# ADR-001: Use Passkeys for Passwordless Authentication

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2025-12-25

## Context

Passwords are vulnerable to phishing, credential stuffing, and reuse.
The system needs a strong, user-friendly authentication method suitable
for production.

## Decision

Adopt passkeys using WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless authentication.

## Consequences

- Improves phishing resistance and reduces credential stuffing risk.
- Reduces reliance on shared secrets and password reset flows.
- Requires WebAuthn-capable clients and server-side verification of
  assertions.
- Requires operational support for registration, recovery, and revocation.
